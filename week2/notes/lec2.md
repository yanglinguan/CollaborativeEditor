# Week 2
## Node.js
* single thread non-blocking I/O
* I/O
* file read/write
* database
* network I/O

* Event-Driven
* event -> event queue -> event handler process the event
* handler name should be matched with the event name

* Multi threaded server
* context swich is expensive
* Multi Thread: keep the states of all threads thread pool
* When I/O happends, new thread will be create to handle I/O
* Thread will not be blocked when I/O happends
* Node.js: good at job which has a lot of I/O
* Multi threaded: good at job which use more CPU (computation)

## RESTful API

* 

## NoSQL
* big data: too many data to store in one marchine. Then relation database
